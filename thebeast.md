#The Beast  
is still under development. It is aimed to be a After Effects CS4+ script for creating georeferenced graphics. The idea is to use a [Json](http://www.json.org/) specification called [GeoJson](http://www.geojson.org/) to create points, linestrings polygons and multipolygons.  
How will this work?  
Be patient young Jedi. The Beast will reveal itself in time.
When will this be done?  
A really can't tell. But when it is done you will be notified via "The Web".  

-----------------  

If you want to take a peak into a AE project created with The Beast take a look at this [The Beast Placemarks Demo.tsv](asset/the_beast_placemarks_demo.tsv.txt). It is build with [pt_openSesame.jsx](http://aescripts.com/pt_opensesame/) so you can import it to any AE version.
