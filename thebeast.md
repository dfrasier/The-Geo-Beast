#The Beast  
is still under development. It is aimed to be a After Effects CS4+ script for creating georeferenced graphics. The idea is to use a [Json](http://www.json.org/) specification called [GeoJson](http://www.geojson.org/) to create points, linestrings polygons and multipolygons.  
#FAQ  

-----------------

###How will this work?   
Be patient young Jedi. The Beast will reveal itself in time.  

-----------------

###When will this be done?   
A really can't tell. But when it is done you will be notified via "The Web".   

-----------------

###Will this script be open-source?
Yes it shure will. I use so many open source ressources I would ruin my karma if I charge you for that. But still - some support is great. So it will be "Name Your Own Price" on aescripts.    

-----------------

###Why do you call it The Beast?  
Managing geodata is allways a pain in the ass. I've used to create geo projects at the university and it always made me nuts. If you start doing that. Be aware that it is a rabbits hole. There are thousends of diffrent geo data types, map projections, tools and images out there in the wastelands of the world wide world of webs. So you can get lost or be eaten by that beast.  
Also  I digg names like "openSesame", "Ease and Wizz", "Zorro-The-Layer-Tagger" or "Magnum The Edit Detector". These are good ideas and keep life on the funny side.

-----------------

###Are you nuts?  
No it's me who is normal - not the other way around. ;)

-----------------

###Isn't that "FAQ with questions nobody asked" joke old?  
Maybe but i didn't use him yet -and it's still funnyâ€¦

-----------------   

###You want more?
If you want to take a peak into a AE project created with The Beast take a look at this [The Beast Placemarks Demo.tsv](asset/the_beast_placemarks_demo.tsv.txt). It is build with [pt_openSesame.jsx](http://aescripts.com/pt_opensesame/) so you can import it to any AE version.
