#1000 loads
This is pretty amazing. In 4 month? I would not have thought of that. I promise i will work hard on The Beast to get it done asap. Untill then check out [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg764rwXIX8), or the [ae demo project](asset/the_beast_placemarks_demo.tsv.txt). It is build with [pt_openSesame.jsx](http://aescripts.com/pt_opensesame/). So you can import it into any AE CS3+.  
The geo markers in there are created with [this data set](http://geocommons.com/maps/183647) from geocommons.org.
